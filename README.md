How can I gain access?

1-) To understand, you must first identify the extensions in your browser. (Chrome, Edge, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)

2-) You might see that your browser is different, in Edge, for example, when you access "edge://extensions," it shows up 2 buttons that say "Load without package" and "Package extension."

3-) PLEASE NOTE that if you do not see the two buttons, you are not in developer mode on your browser, and you must enable it in order to click on each of these buttons.

4-) Click the Load without Package button and pick the MrBallenify-YT-Image repository.

5-) When you are done, you will be prompted with "Details," "Remove," and "Reload." If the extension appears with errors, you can direct me to "https://github.com/AxiomaticAlan/MrBallenify-YT-Image/issues"

6-) Once you are done, go to https://youtube.com or https://youtube.com/channel (of a specific username), click on the "Toggle Image Overlay" icon, and you are ready to go!
